# Self-Checkout

•	Wrote a Java program that executes a fool proof self-checkout simulation from a consumers perspective. 

•	This application walks the user through a 4 step shopping experience. The user can set up shop by inputting specific items with specific prices and also set a price where items will qualify for a specific discount. Next, the user can enter the number of items they would like to purchase. Following this step the program lists the selected items and prices and proceeds to checkout and the program concludes. 

•	The goal of this project was to create a self-checkout simulation that would allow the user to purchase items in a specified order. If the user made attempt to go out of order, they would be prompted to return to the appropriate step in the checkout process.
